# MICA occurrence datasets

## Rationale

This repository contains the functionality to standardize several datasets of **Muskrat and Coypu occurrences** to [Darwin Core Occurrence](https://www.gbif.org/dataset-classes) datasets that can be harvested by [GBIF](http://www.gbif.org). These datasets are published in the framework of the project [Management of Invasive Coypu and muskrAt in Europe (MICA)](https://lifemica.eu/).

## Repo structure

The structure for each dataset in [datasets](datasets) is based on [Cookiecutter Data Science](http://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/) and the [Checklist recipe](https://github.com/trias-project/checklist-recipe). Files and directories indicated with `GENERATED` should not be edited manually.
