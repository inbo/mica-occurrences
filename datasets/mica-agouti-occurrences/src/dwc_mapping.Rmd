```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = TRUE)
```

Load libraries:

```{r message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(here)
library(camtraptor)
library(EML)
```

## Read data

```{r}
agouti_export <- "~/Downloads/mica-muskrat-and-coypu-20220708094154/datapackage.json"
package <- camtraptor::read_camtrap_dp(agouti_export)
```

## Round coordinates

Round coordinates to 3 decimals to generalize location information in order prevent theft of active cameras, see <https://github.com/inbo/mica-occurrences/issues/6>. This results in a coordinate uncertainty of 187 m (157 + default 30).

```{r}
package <- camtraptor::round_coordinates(package, 3)
```

## Create EML

Add missing `package` properties:

  "<![CDATA[<em>MICA - Muskrat and coypu camera trap observations in Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany</em> is an occurrence dataset published by the Research Institute of Nature and Forest (INBO). It is part of the LIFE project MICA, in which innovative techniques are tested for a more efficient control of muskrat and coypu populations, both invasive species. The dataset contains camera trap observations of muskrat and coypu, as well as many other observed species. Issues with the dataset can be reported at <a href=\"https://github.com/inbo/mica-occurrences/issues\">https://github.com/inbo/mica-occurrences/issues</a>]]>",
